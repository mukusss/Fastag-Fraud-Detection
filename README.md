This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. Fastag is an electronic toll collection system in India that uses RFID technology to make toll payments directly from a prepaid account linked to a userâ€™s vehicle. As digital transactions become more prevalent, the risk of fraudulent activities also increases. This project aims to leverage machine learning classification techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, thereby ensuring the security and integrity of Fastag transactions.
